# Hotel Booking Revenue and Cancellation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 79,080 hotel bookings to identify revenue drivers, cancellation risk factors, and guest behavior patterns. The objective was to provide leadership with clear, data driven insights to protect and optimize a 24 million dollar revenue portfolio.

The final output is an executive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables, calculated metrics, and interactive filters.

## Business Problem

The hotel portfolio experienced a 29.1 percent cancellation rate, creating revenue instability and forecasting uncertainty. Leadership required deeper visibility into:

- What drives booking cancellations  
- How seasonal demand impacts pricing power  
- Which market segments generate the highest revenue  
- Whether deposit policies effectively reduce risk  
- How guest engagement influences retention  

The goal was to transform raw booking data into actionable strategic insight.

- Created a calculated Total Revenue field totaling 23,871,662.75 dollars  
- Grouped Lead Time into booking windows to analyze cancellation trends  
- Built KPI summary cards for executive level monitoring  
- Developed interactive pivot charts with slicers for Hotel Type and Year  

### Tools Used

- Pivot Tables  
- Pivot Charts  
- Calculated Fields  
- Data Binning  
- Slicers

## Key Performance Indicators

- Total Revenue: 23,871,662 dollars  
- Total Bookings: 79,080  
- Average Daily Rate: 110.35 dollars  
- Cancellation Rate: 29.1 percent  
- Engagement Score: 0.725 average requests per guest

## Strategic Insights

### Seasonal Pricing Performance

Average Daily Rate peaks in August at 154.38 dollars, confirming strong seasonal pricing leverage during high demand months.

### Lead Time Risk Exposure

Cancellation probability increases significantly with longer booking windows. Reservations made more than 300 days in advance show a 53 percent cancellation rate, indicating long term booking fragility.

### Channel Profitability

Direct bookings generate the highest Average Daily Rate at 121.91 dollars, outperforming third party and agency channels.

### Deposit Policy Anomaly

Non Refundable bookings display a 95.1 percent cancellation rate. This counterintuitive result suggests potential data inconsistencies or policy enforcement issues requiring further investigation.

### Engagement and Retention

Guest engagement strongly correlates with retention. Bookings with five special requests show only a 5.7 percent cancellation rate compared to 36.2 percent for guests with zero requests.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

- Conduct a detailed audit of Non Refundable booking records  
- Implement automated reconfirmation workflows for long lead bookings  
- Strengthen incentives for direct booking channels  
- Encourage guest personalization during booking to increase commitment  

---

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that cancellation risk is primarily driven by long booking windows and low guest engagement rather than seasonality alone. By improving reconfirmation processes, strengthening direct channel growth, and addressing deposit policy inconsistencies, the hotel can reduce revenue leakage and improve forecasting stability.

The dashboard serves as a centralized decision support tool for monitoring revenue health, customer behavior, and operational risk.
